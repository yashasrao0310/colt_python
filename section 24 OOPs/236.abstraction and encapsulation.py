# Encapsulation - the grouping of public and private attributes and methods 
# into a programming class, making abstraction posssible.

# Abstraction - exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface, 
# hiding private attributes and methods(aka the "inner workings") from users
# Ex:in a bus we just use the steering, we don't need to know how the steering mechanism works
