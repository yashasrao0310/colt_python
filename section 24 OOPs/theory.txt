OOP - creating real world objects via classes(to represent them)
def: Object oreinted programming is a method of programming that attempts to 
model some process or thing in the world as a class or object.

Class - a blueprint(recipes or specifications) for objects. Classes can contain methods 
    (functions) and attributes(similar to keys in a dict).

Instance: objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contain 
    their class's methods and properties.
Note: user obj is created based on the user class
    ex:dict objects are based out od dict classes.

help() - method to receive info aabout classes,funcs or other things in python.
    nums = [1,2,3] # creating an instance of list class

why OOP?
With OOP, the goal is to encapsulate your code into logical,hierarchical
    grouping using classes so that you can reason about your code at a higher level.
