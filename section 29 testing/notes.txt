TDD - test driven developemnt

testing - writing tests/code that tests your other written code.
    can write tests are different times in developemnt(ex: when deploying new feature, when done with application, etc)

why test?
    - reduce bugs in existing code.
    - ensure bugs that are fixed stay fixed.
most important - ENSURE NEW FEATURES DON'T BREAK OLD/EXISTING ONES.
(when your working a large production application with many developers)
    - ensure that cleaning up code doesn't introduce new bugs.
    - makes development more fun!(when your tests pass)

TDD - test driven development:(philosophy)
    - development begins by writing tests.
    - once tests are written , write code to make tests pass.
    - Once tests pass, a feature is considered complete.

red, green, refactor:(workflow) - it refers to the colors of your tests(passing/failing)
    1.red - write test that fails
    2.green - write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the tests pass.
    3.Refactor - clean up the code, while ensuring that tests still pass
